Task 1 – List Your Start-up Expenses

Create a numbered list of all the relevant expenses to starting your business.

Purchasing deadstock inventory from brands

Website hosting and domain name

Packaging materials (boxes, tape, labels)

Photography equipment (lighting, camera/phone accessories)

Marketing/advertising (social media ads, influencer partnerships)

Shipping costs

Graphic design or logo creation

Business registration / permits

Task 2 – Estimate The Costs

Copy and paste your list from Task 1 and add rough costs.

Purchasing deadstock inventory — $500

Website hosting and domain name — $100

Packaging materials — $50

Photography equipment — $200

Marketing/advertising — $150

Shipping costs — $100

Graphic design / logo creation — $50

Business registration / permits — $75

Task 3 – Create a Financial Snapshot
Step 1: Divide expenses into categories

One-Time Expenses

Photography equipment — $200

Graphic design / logo creation — $50

Business registration / permits — $75

Monthly Expenses

Website hosting — $10/month → $120/year

Packaging materials — $50/month → $600/year

Marketing/advertising — $50/month → $600/year

Shipping costs — $30/month → $360/year

Recurring But Not Monthly Expenses

Purchasing deadstock inventory — $500 per major restock (assume 4 times/year)

Step 2: Project 3-Year Costs

Monthly expenses projected for 3 years:
• Website hosting + packaging + marketing + shipping = $10 + $50 + $50 + $30 = $140/month
• 3 years = 36 months → 36 × $140 = $5,040

Recurring but not monthly (inventory purchases 4×/year × 3 years):
• $500 × 4 × 3 = $6,000

Step 2 Total: $5,040 + $6,000 = $11,040

Step 3: Add all 3 categories to determine total start-up costs

One-Time Expenses: $200 + $50 + $75 = $325
3-Year Recurring & Monthly Expenses: $11,040

Total Business Start-up Cost: $325 + $11,040 = $11,365
